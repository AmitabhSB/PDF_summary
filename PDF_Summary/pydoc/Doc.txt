Problem Statement : 

Read a PDF file of any book and write a python 2.7 program to identify summarize each chapter in 1 page.

PDF_Summary 

main.py is a program written in python that takes input arguments as : 

Source PDF file with path .
Example : "C:\Users\AMITABH\Desktop\PDF_Summary\pdf\short _stories.pdf" 
Path to the directory where PDF split files of every chapter are saved in .pdf format .
Example : "C:\Users\AMITABH\Desktop\PDF_Summary\pdf\pdf_split_files" 
Path to the directory where PDF split files of every chapter are saved in .txt format .
Example : "C:\Users\AMITABH\Desktop\PDF_Summary\Text_files"
Path to the directory where Summary of all the chapters are saved in .txt format .
Example : "C:/Users/AMITABH/Desktop/PDF_Summary/Summary"

and creates Summary of every Chapter.

Installation  Requirements :

Make sure you have [Python](http://www.python.org/) 2.7/3.3+ and
[pip](https://crate.io/packages/pip/)
([Windows](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/),
[Linux](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/))

Install Sumy :


$ [sudo] pip install sumy
For windows cmd :
>python -m pip install sumy

Or for the fresh version:
	$ [sudo] pip install git+git://github.com/miso-belica/sumy.git

Documentation : (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sumy)

*  I have used sumy like a library in your project.I


2. Install PdfMiner :

$ [sudo] pip install pdfminer

For windows cmd :
>python -m pip install pdfminer

*I have used PyPDF2 as a library and code is available at https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/manipulating-pdfs-with-python/167

3. Install PyPDF2 :

$ [sudo] pip install PyPDF2

For windows cmd :
>python -m pip install PyPDF2

Running program from Command Prompt (windows)

Step 1 : Go into PDF_Summary folder where you will find “main.py” python file.

Step 2 : run command 

Example :
 C:\Users\AMITABH\Desktop\PDF_Summary\py>pdftoChapterwiseSummaryFinal.py  “C:\Users\AMITABH\Desktop\PDF_Summary\pdf\short _stories.pdf" "C:\Users\AMITABH\Desktop\PDF_Summary\pdf\pdf_split_files" "C:\Users\AMITABH\Desktop\PDF_Summary\Text_files" "C:/Users/AMITABH/Desktop/PDF_Summary/Summary"

Step 3 : You can check a Summary.txt file is created in Specified folder.



How it Works :

To create summary of each chapter this program uses a Library in Python called “sumy” that takes plaintext as input file and return summary of the file .
First we need to convert a .pdf file into a .txt file (Chapterwise).
This program takes a PDF file as Input and splits it into different Chapters and saves them in .pdf format in a directory named “pdf_split_files” with prefix name “Split_Chapter_”+ title of the Chapter .
From the directory where split pdf files are saved it then converts each chapter .pdf file into a .txt file (with same name as of .pdf file) and saves them into a different directory named “Text_Files” .
It then passes each chapter to a Summarizer .
There are different algorithms that can be used to create summary such as :
Luhn - heuristic method ,

SumBasic - Method that is often used as a baseline in the literature. Source: [Read about SumBasic] (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nenkova/papers/ipm.pdf)
KL-Sum - Method that greedily adds sentences to a summary so long as it decreases the KL Divergence. Source: [Read about KL-Sum] (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N09-1041)
At last the summary of every chapter is written into a file Summary.txt 
  For every chapter it creates a summary of 30 lines .
