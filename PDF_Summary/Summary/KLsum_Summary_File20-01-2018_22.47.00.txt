	It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map.It stared back.He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more.He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind.He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid.He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning.The cat didn't move.In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something.But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness.on the wall next to the cat.She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun.It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of aHe looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets."Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer.He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

Title : CHAPTER 2 - The Vanishing Glass
	A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.There had been a flying motorcycle in it."In the car crash when your parents died," she had said."Comb your hair!"together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.His face fell."Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father."Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."It looked like hard work."Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father."That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...."In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted."Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!""I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right upOn the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.But today, nothing was going to go wrong."... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a motorcycle overtook them."It was flying."It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls."Make it move," he whined at his father.Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching."It must be really annoying."He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died.He couldn't remember his parents at all.Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.

Title : CHAPTER 3 - The Letters From No One
	Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters.They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking.It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question."Your new school uniform," she said.The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink.Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"He sat down on the bed and stared around him.The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it.When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" as he worked, and jumped at small noises."Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?"He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.The woman stared.Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.Dud ley sniveled.Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.One thing was certain, there was no television in there."And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!"A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.It was freezing in the boat.Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty.He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.

Title : CHAPTER 4 - The Keeper of the Keys
	He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.A giant of a man was standing in the doorway."Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh?"Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger.said the giant."Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right."He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there.The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burntThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud!Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?"Your world.Yer parents' world.""But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said.I forbid you to tell the boy anything!"With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be?Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone."You knew?""Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --""But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead?"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"That's the biggest myst'ry, see... he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?"Yer mad.

Title : CHAPTER 5 - Diagon Alley
	I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff -- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that."Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither."Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts.The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm."Yeah -- but we'll go back in this.And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see.Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat."Three sets of plain work robes (black)For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby."Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.Hagrid grinned at Harry.studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy.About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that."Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh."He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes."My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," said the boy.He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy.If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk."An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level."Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze.For some reason, the back of his neck prickled."Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said.

Title : CHAPTER 6 - The Journey From Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
	The train pulled out of the station.His school books were very interesting.He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?"He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train.He left without another word.According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten."All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes.The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door.Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.If I get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.The train began to move."Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there.""I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work.He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand."Oh, are you doing magic?"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you."So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money.Both Harry and Ron stood up.Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once."You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there.Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately."They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door.

Title : CHAPTER 7 - The Sorting Hat
	The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat.This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty.Then the hat twitched.A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:A smarter hat than me."When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said.A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down.Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.He sat back down.Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors!Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning.Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row!Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- "Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore."First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils.Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words."Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes.A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.

Title : CHAPTER 8 - The Potions Master
	At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress."Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.He's chewing my sheets.""Next to the tall kid with the red hair."There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump.Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class.He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!"Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized theyBy the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true."Just then, the mail arrived.circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.It said, in a very untidy scrawl:I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses....I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."More silence followed this little speech."Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything.""Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming,Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the cornerI spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest."Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it."Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students."How's yer brother Charlie?"It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:

Title : CHAPTER 9 - The Midnight Duel
	Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground."Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.She turned to the rest of the class.You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.'He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful.He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin.he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist."Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --"What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.They both looked up.They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up."They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows.Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness.Then a noise in the next room made them jump.He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs."I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads."

Title : CHAPTER 10 - Halloween
	But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.Oliver Wood had arrived."Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting."Right," said Wood."This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood.said Wood curiously."I'll show you now," said Wood.Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely."Very good," said Wood.Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball."This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot."We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it."That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle.And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest."he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose.They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars.Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.

Title : CHAPTER 11 - Quidditch
	taken on a full-grown mountain troll.They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady."Pig snout," they said and entered.Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.Every morning the ground was covered in frost."Give it to me.He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.One of his legs was bloody and mangled."How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?""I just wondered if I could have my book back."He sprinted back upstairs.And Id bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!""I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."Good luck, all of you."knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle."And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead"Budge up there, move along.""Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?"busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold.For a split second, he thought he was going to fall.Then the whole crowd gasped."Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand."He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."

Title : CHAPTER 12 - The Mirror of Erised
	He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather.When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible.It is time it was returned to you."She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table.After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.He stopped, his heart racing, and thought.One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming!He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.That had been close, very close.The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.He looked in the mirror again.A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving.He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him.If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her.And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses."You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror."And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone."Don't go back tonight."But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.

Title : CHAPTER 13 - Nicolas Flamel
	He started having nightmares.Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks.Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits.If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years."That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match!The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.If I back out,How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse.He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."He stared at the back of the card."I've found him!"I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!""I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."At last she found what she was looking for."Oh, honestly, don't you two read?said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either."Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time?See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains."We've won!He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more.He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices.He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves."Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?""We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.""We won!Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens."He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.

Title : CHAPTER 14 - Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback
	Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through --"Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe.They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones.What are you doing in the library?""And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --""Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?"Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.""Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, " said Harry."Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that.Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget."That Stone's here fer a good reason.Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course.In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger."Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here.Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour.He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head.It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.It had grown three times in length in just a week.There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief."I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week.When it bit me he told me off for frightening it.Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite?He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."

Title : CHAPTER 15 - The Forbidden Forest
	They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them.He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time.It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed....They marched off across the dark grounds."Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?""I bin waitin' fer half an hour already."I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'dHolding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat."And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?"Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions.Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let's go."A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail."There's summat bad loose in this forest."Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?""So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?"There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin' about it?""Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh?They walked on through the dense, dark trees."Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!"They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick.Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white onThe forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you.You have a human on your back!It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!""Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?""Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...."

Title : CHAPTER 16 - Through the Trapdoor
	One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out.The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows."Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then...I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks.... Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home....So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep --""We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.""Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled.Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.He ran back down to the common room."Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!"If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough...They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them.It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room.He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened.bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole."That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side."The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all.He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse.The black knight nodded."We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's."At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.""Which one will get you back through the purple flames?"She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
