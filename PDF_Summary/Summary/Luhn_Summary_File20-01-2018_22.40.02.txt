	Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight.It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs.As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people!The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat downShe jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window.Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid.People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.""I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry.No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course.Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets."But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -""Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.""I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore, nodding to her.He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.

Title : CHAPTER 2 - The Vanishing Glass
	One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley...Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother.Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap.said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this."I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car...."said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother.He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them.Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar."But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling.The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor.Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished.People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.

Title : CHAPTER 3 - The Letters From No One
	Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day.Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings."They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall," he told Harry.One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's."DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia.Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry.He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach."Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it.When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him.After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do.Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window.While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue.Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going.Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way.Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon.Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.

Title : CHAPTER 4 - The Keeper of the Keys
	She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time."Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise."Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on."Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a very happy birthday to yeh.From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box.An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud!"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first.another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly."How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter?Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers.Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened."Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew.Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side."But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry.But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent."That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him."If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him," growled Hagrid."Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts!

Title : CHAPTER 5 - Diagon Alley
	I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff -- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school."Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts."If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see.wand cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) setCould there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement.Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'.""Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses."We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor."Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes.Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze.Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait.We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons.Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious... curious..The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.

Title : CHAPTER 6 - The Journey From Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
	True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.They reached King's Cross at half past ten.Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, andHe stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters.According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar.Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner.The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough."Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life.It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs."But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos."Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them.Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner."Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep."You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter," said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses.He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once.Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs' years!

Title : CHAPTER 7 - The Sorting Hat
	Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall."The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin."Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me."Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat.Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them." Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous.When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "MacDougal, Morag.""Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!"As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him.The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore."Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.Harry's mouth fell open.He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs."I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors!Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore.The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries.There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head.

Title : CHAPTER 8 - The Potions Master
	They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge."Snape's Head of Slytherin House.Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name."Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter.He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort."What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything."Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked."For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death."Doi* push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.""Cheer up," said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George.Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang -- back.""This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.

Title : CHAPTER 9 - The Midnight Duel
	He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived."Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips."Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter."Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil."It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron."No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called.He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle.Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him."He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor McGonagall told Wood."Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained."I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you."Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing).On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room."Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells."Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky.Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "I -- told -- you."They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor."Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.

Title : CHAPTER 10 - Halloween
	Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle."What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle," Malfoy snapped back.I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.""Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball."The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score," Harry recited."Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm Keeper for Gryffindor.He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face."Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry reeled off.You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they"We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it.He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom.Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice.squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual."Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick."You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap.On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

Title : CHAPTER 11 - Quidditch
	Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye."He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away."Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row."And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson."We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the team last year."Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year.Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him.Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall."And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are aheadGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins."Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint."Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?"A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, tooA roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life."But this isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him.Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.""Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd."I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look."Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing."He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.

Title : CHAPTER 12 - The Mirror of Erised
	You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel --"While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms."I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home."Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving."I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry'sThen, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it.He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back," and hurried from the room."I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.

Title : CHAPTER 13 - Nicolas Flamel
	If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years.Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news.Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.Gryffindor can't play at all.""You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said.As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a"The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone!It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again.Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too."Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time?Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --"Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices.Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone.

Title : CHAPTER 14 - Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback
	Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter."Ten weeks," Hermione snapped.They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me....""I'll never remember this," Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window."Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?"It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous.Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget."Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy."Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course.Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it."Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was."Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow."Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here.Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous."He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered in Harry's ear.Harry suddenly turned to Ron.And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to ask him.Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak.He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size.Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me."Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.

Title : CHAPTER 15 - The Forbidden Forest
	Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt.All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.""Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him.All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would beHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table."I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness."Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks.Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right."It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures.Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground."Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?""Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently.A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in here lately?They're deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much."They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm."Look --" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front.Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question.They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore."This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn.Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return."Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...."They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me....

Title : CHAPTER 16 - Through the Trapdoor
	When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them.Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken byHe watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth.So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep --""We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'"No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back!"Better get the cloak," Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning.He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them."Keep playing," Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor."I think we'll be able to pull the door open," said Ron, peering over the dog's back.In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep."Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck."Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say?Winged keys -- look carefully.After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse.The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side.With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway."We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's."Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him.Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
