	This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people!"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word ("Won't!").Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?"Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter."This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said Professor McGonagall."A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all.really has gone, Dumbledore?""It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore.It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late.Harry Potter come and live here!"But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?""I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless.Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets."Yes," said Dumbledore."Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house."Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

Title : CHAPTER 2 - The Vanishing Glass
	The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.His aunt was back outside the door."Nearly," said Harry.Petunia was how he had gotten it.Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, "And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today."Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia.'Atta boy, Dudley!"Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this.Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon."I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car...."In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother.Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside."I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly.Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.I know they don't," said Harry.If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time.He looked back at the snake and winked, too.Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.

Title : CHAPTER 3 - The Letters From No One
	Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang."No, thanks," said Harry.One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's."Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper."Make Dudley get it."shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter."Vernon!Dudley wasn't used to being ignored.I WANT MY LETTER!""But what should we do, Vernon?That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard."Where's my letter?"said Harry.The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room.They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.Harry wasUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand."Dudley -- go -- just go."Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face.After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out.He'd never had such a bad day in his life.Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way.He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again.Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.

Title : CHAPTER 4 - The Keeper of the Keys
	The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time."An' here's Harry!""Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes.""Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a very happy birthday to yeh.Harry looked up at the giant.An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud!Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?"Harry -- yet a wizard."An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."Given Harry his letter.Hagridsaid Harry."I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know.Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'."He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --"Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers.Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened."Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew."But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry.Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage."Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard?Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.said Hagrid."Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.""Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts!

Title : CHAPTER 5 - Diagon Alley
	"Hagrid!""Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school."Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts.Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.""If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see."'Course," said Hagrid.Things these Muggles dream up, eh?""Well, so they say," said Hagrid."If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.Harry didn't know what to say.said Hagrid.Come on, Harry."He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping."Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him."Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone take you down to both vaults.He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes."Yes," said Harry."My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands," said the boy."No," said Harry."Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy.said Hagrid.Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.Harry tried.Harry took the wand.Harry kept looking around."You all right, Harry?

Title : CHAPTER 6 - The Journey From Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
	True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all."Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train.Harry didn't say anything.According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished."I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy.Ron's new, too.""Yes," said Harry.Go on, go now before Ron."He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar.said Harry."Oh, him," said Harry.Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.And look after Ron."their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train."Five," said Ron.Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny.Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."said Harry."No," said Ron.said Harry.said Ron."Help yourself," said Harry.Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you."Harry Potter," said Harry."You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter," said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses.He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time."Yes," said Harry.All right there, Harry?"

Title : CHAPTER 7 - The Sorting Hat
	Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall."The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose.Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too.For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting HatThe Sorting Hat can't see,Harry."When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said.The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them." Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him.Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall.He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet.Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got Potter!"Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors!Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.asked Seamus with great interest."Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages.On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore.The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase."Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years.

Title : CHAPTER 8 - The Potions Master
	Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts.And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves.Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons.Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class.His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.said Snape suddenly."I don't know, sit," said Harry.Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?"Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.Over the noise, Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter."Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much?Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang -- back.""Back, Fang."Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.Hagrid asked Ron.While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.

Title : CHAPTER 9 - The Midnight Duel
	As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid."Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.Harry ignored her."But Malfoy --"Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys."He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor McGonagall told Wood."Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained.Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.said Harry.Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.said Ron."Good-bye," said Ron."Come on," he said to Ron.Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them."D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?"Keep your voice down, Neville.said Harry."Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later --"Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet.Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice."We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as possible.""Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry."Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly.Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what.Ron stared after her, his mouth open.

Title : CHAPTER 10 - Halloween
	"Or both," said Harry.Ron couldn't resist it."Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly.said Harry.It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night.The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch."This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood."Stand back," Wood warned Harry."Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry reeled off.And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open."Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap.On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone."How could a troll get in?""I've just thought -- Hermione.""She doesn't know about the troll.""He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club."Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said Professor McGonagall.Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

Title : CHAPTER 11 - Quidditch
	There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor."I'm with Harry.I wouldn't put anything past Snape.He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget.Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row.She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year.Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall."And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead"Harry hasn't had much to do yet.""Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had said."All right there, Harry?""Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?"Harry saw it.Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession."Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd."He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione.Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still.Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom."He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty."It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him.

Title : CHAPTER 12 - The Mirror of Erised
	"We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere.""Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?"Nothing," said Harry.He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel."And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron.Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel."You, too," said Harry.I told her you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley sweater.""Nothing," said Harry."Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater."Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?""Christmas is a time for family."Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.Harry said nothing.fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving.And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life."You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror."You can see them any old time," said Ron.said Ron.What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again.Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats?And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.said Ron."I'm serious, Harry, don't go."But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him."So -- back again, Harry?"Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice.

Title : CHAPTER 13 - Nicolas Flamel
	Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years."Snape's refereeing?"Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.said Ron."Thanks, Harry...As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione."I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."Hermione ignored him.said Harry and Ron.She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, asaid Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!""A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"said Harry."No wonder Snape's after it!"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione.Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door."I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione."Ron!"Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground."Come on, Harry!""Ron!Ron!As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.And speaking of Snape..."Harry, where have you been?"

Title : CHAPTER 14 - Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback
	Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside."There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said Harry, "about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --"said Hagrid again."See you later, then," said Harry."Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, " said Harry.said Harry."Of course there are," said Ron."Yes," said Harry.Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione."Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was.If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it.aren't you, Hagrid?""Hagrid, can we"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid."Hagrid -- what's that?""Where did you get it, Hagrid?"Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too."Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?"said Hagrid.Malfoy had seen the dragon.Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous.They looked at the dragon.Harry suddenly turned to Ron.Studying dragons.said Ron."How about it, Hagrid?"Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down."Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."

Title : CHAPTER 15 - The Forbidden Forest
	Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other."Harry!"Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt.All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor."So what do we do, Harry?"said Harry.Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think.Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.All right, Harry, Hermione?"Malfoy now turned to Hagrid."There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid.So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other.Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground."Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?""Yeah," said Hagrid, "but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan?"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently.A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.said Harry."Hagrid!So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front.A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body."You had better get back to Hagrid.The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you."Harry!Harry, are you all right?""The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.""Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze.Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.

Title : CHAPTER 16 - Through the Trapdoor
	Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by"We've got to go to Dumbledore," said Harry."Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under thatThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction.They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back."One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it.Hermione, you'd better do that."No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in."I'm sorry, Harry!"Harry said.said Hermione.If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back!If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side!Harry and Ron didn't talk much."Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.Harry turned to Hermione."You'll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak."I think we'll be able to pull the door open," said Ron, peering over the dog's back.And Harry let go.he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!""Probably," said Harry.They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side.With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway."Snape's," said Harry.Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple."Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him."But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"
