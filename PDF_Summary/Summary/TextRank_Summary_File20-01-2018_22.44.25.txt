	Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people!Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter."While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley.Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat downreally has gone, Dumbledore?""It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore.Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now."Dumbledore -- you can't.But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?"Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets."Yes," said Dumbledore."Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house."Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.""I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore, nodding to her.Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

Title : CHAPTER 2 - The Vanishing Glass
	"Nearly," said Harry.Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody.Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him.Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother.Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap.Harry hated it there.said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this."You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer).Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside."I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry.Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney.The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.I know they don't," said Harry.The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.Harry stared.Harry asked.As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?"Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.

Title : CHAPTER 3 - The Letters From No One
	Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings.One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's.As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life.Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform.Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry.Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach.They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room."Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them.Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door.The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it.Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him.Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind.After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do.Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way.

Title : CHAPTER 4 - The Keeper of the Keys
	Harry couldn't sleep."An' here's Harry!""Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room."Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a very happy birthday to yeh.Harry looked up at the giant.An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course."Er -- no," said Harry."Sorry," Harry said quickly.I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud!asked Harry.Hagrid stared wildly at Harry."Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare."Yeh don' know what yeh are?"A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.said Harry eagerly."Harry -- yet a wizard."gasped Harry."A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit.Given Harry his letter.said Harry, interested.said Harry.Harry had gone very white.Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'.""Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."Harry suggested.That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry.Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got hisHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him."Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts."

Title : CHAPTER 5 - Diagon Alley
	Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock."Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks.Harry asked."Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?"If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him.In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it."Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.Harry didn't know what to say.said Hagrid.Come on, Harry."Hagrid grinned at Harry."Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.Harry asked.Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.Harry asked."Yes," said Harry."No," said Harry."That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.said Hagrid.While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.Harry Potter."He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.Harry tried.Harry took the wand.Harry kept looking around."You all right, Harry?

Title : CHAPTER 6 - The Journey From Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
	True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.Harry didn't say anything.Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose."Yes," said Harry."Er -- okay," said Harry.said Harry."Oh, him," said Harry."Harry Potter!""Bye," said Harry and Ron."Are you really Harry Potter?"asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.said Harry.Harry went out into the corridor.Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.said Harry."Help yourself," said Harry.Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them."You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry."He'll turn up," said Harry."Harry Potter," said Harry.asked Harry.Harry stared."Yes," said Harry.He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.Both Harry and Ron stood up.I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to Harry.All right there, Harry?"Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.

Title : CHAPTER 7 - The Sorting Hat
	Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.Harry swallowed.Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too.Ron whispered to Harry.Harry.The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment.shouted the hat." Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide."Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.shouted the hat.What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?The Harry Potter?"The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him.Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall."Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!""Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin.Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.Potatoes, Harry?"Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.Harry clapped a hand to his head.Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

Title : CHAPTER 8 - The Potions Master
	Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron.Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge."Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry.Harry tore it open at once.Dear Harry,Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him.Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name."Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter.Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air."I don't know, sit," said Harry."I don't know," said Harry quietly.Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron."This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons.Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson.Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.

Title : CHAPTER 9 - The Midnight Duel
	Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years."Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly.Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.Harry ignored her.Harry knew, somehow, what to do.Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady."No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called.Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle."Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us."When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.said Harry.Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry."And it's really none of your business," said Harry.said Harry.Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room."Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry.Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what.But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed

Title : CHAPTER 10 - Halloween
	Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful."Or both," said Harry.Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.Ron grinned at Harry.Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion.said Harry."Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.Harry landed next to him."Stand back," Wood warned Harry.He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch."You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap.On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.Harry whispered."He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.Harry gasped.Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.Its mean little eyes saw Harry.The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.Harry got to his feet.I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out."Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.Harry had never seen her look so angry.Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.Harry was speechless.Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

Title : CHAPTER 11 - Quidditch
	Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret.Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.Harry showed him."He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away.Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them.Harry felt restless.Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it."Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.Harry gulped.Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor.Ron asked as Harry joined them."I'm with Harry.He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget."And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead"Harry hasn't had much to do yet.""All right there, Harry?"Harry saw it.A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still.Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.Harry heard none of this, though.Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.

Title : CHAPTER 12 - The Mirror of Erised
	said Harry eagerly."So why did he just try and kill Harry?""Nothing," said Harry.Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess."Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe."You, too," said Harry."That's friendly," said Harry."You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell."Nothing," said Harry."Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater.Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry'sHarry said nothing.And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.Harry couldn't eat.said Ron.Harry hissed.Harry whispered.Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats?And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.said Ron."I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror."I'm serious, Harry, don't go."But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him."So -- back again, Harry?"Harry thought.Harry stood up.Harry stared.

Title : CHAPTER 13 - Nicolas Flamel
	"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her."Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of Harry's face.Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee."I can't," said Harry.Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron."Thanks, Harry...Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.said Harry and Ron.She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, asaid Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.said Harry.It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione.Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went.Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again.Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse.They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --""Come on, Harry!"Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.Harry's won!As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face."Harry, where have you been?"shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back.

Title : CHAPTER 14 - Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback
	Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.Harry, who was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, "Hagrid!said Hagrid again.Hagrid shuffled off."Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, " said Harry."So what on earths Hagrid up to?"said Hermione.Hagrid called "Who is it?"Hagrid frowned at him.Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was.aren't you, Hagrid?""Hagrid, can we"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid."Hagrid -- what's that?""Where did you get it, Hagrid?""Won it," said Hagrid.said Hermione.But Hagrid wasn't listening.Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too.Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break.said Hagrid.Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous."I can't," said Hagrid."Hagrid," said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house."How about it, Hagrid?"Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.

Title : CHAPTER 15 - The Forbidden Forest
	"Harry!"Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him.And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.said Harry miserably.Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy.So what do we do, Harry?"said Harry.Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut.Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad.All right, Harry, Hermione?"So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other.A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.Harry asked.Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak.Harry suggested.Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way.Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.said Harry.He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question."Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?""Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-""Harry!Harry, are you all right?"Harry slid off his back.Harry couldn't sit down.Harry wasn't listening.

	Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken byMaybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry."Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry cut him off."We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in."I'm sorry, Harry!"Harry said.said Ron.said Hermione.said Ron.Harry and Ron didn't talk much.Harry turned to Hermione.Harry whispered."Oh, let's kick her, just this once," Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head.said Ron.And Harry let go.said Hermione.said Ron."Probably," said Harry.said Ron.Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.Harry whispered.said Ron.Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think.The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger.With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.Harry whispered."But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"said Hermione.
