BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 

The Subject of this invention relates to a lensleSS optical 
viewfinder and camera with a lensless viewfinder which is 
not only low in cost but provides a reticle which is visible 
through the Viewfinder when the photographer frames the 
portion of the Scene which will appear in the processed 
picture. The user then can obtain properly framed photoS as 
when using much more expensive cameras. 

This is achieved in the preferred embodiment by employ 
ing two aligned openings in the camera case in the front and 
rear walls of the opaque hollow camera body. 

The inner Surface of the front opening in the camera body 
is surrounded by a concave mirror Surface RC. On the inner 
Surface of the rear wall of the body, Surrounding the rear 
opening RO, is a rectangular frame defining the reticle. 

Incident light,  from the Scene,  is  transmitted  directly 
through the openings to the user, and also illuminates the 
reticle which is more reflective than the inside wall of the 
camera Surrounding the rear opening. 

The concave mirror, Surrounding the inside of the front 
opening and outside of the viewfinder field of view FOV(v?), 
reflects and focuses an image of the reticle to the eye of the 
user who sees the image of the reticle as if it is part of the 
Scene in front of the camera. 

The viewfinder of this invention optionally eliminates the 
need for any refractive material Such as lenses or transparent 
windows in the viewfinder opening. 

In the case of a Zoom lens camera, the Same basic lensleSS 
viewfinder is  formed in  the camera body with its  front 
opening and concave mirror. The reticle, however, is formed 
in two parts,  on diagonally opposite corners of the  rear 
opening, described below. 

Within the camera body in the viewfinder optical path are 
a pair of L-shaped sliding masks which define a variable 

6,122,455 

3 

sized  opening.  These plates  are  coupled to  the  Zoom 
adjustment mechanism to change their spacing and thus to 
change the size of the reticle opening to correspond to the 
field of view of the camera lens. 

By comparison  with  the  prior  viewfinders  discussed

Pros: Bright rectangular frame is 
imaged in the scene. No lenses used 
or associated cost. No motion 
parallax between frame and scene. 
Image of scene remains full size as in 
the most expensive SLRs. Costs 
approximates that of using no 
viewfinder. Quality suitable for more 
expensive cameras as well. 
Cons: ---

Image of scene remains full size as in 
the most expensive SLRs. Costs 
approximates that of using no 
viewfinder. Quality suitable for more 
expensive cameras as well. Provides a 
wider field of view of the scene than 
the reticle, to aid composition. 
Cons: Scene brightness reduced. Edges 
of holes creates some diffraction. 
Accommodates a range of reticle sizes, 
required by Zoom cameras. 
Pros: camera provides accurate frame 
lines, of a size matching that of the 
Zoom lens, without cost of multi 
element Zooming viewfinder lenses. 
Cons: eye relief is slightly reduced 
for wide-angle position. 
Pros: No image minification.

This viewfinder is not limited to cameras but may be used 
in other applications, as well. The Single use camera is a 
prime candidate for its application because of its low cost, 
ease of incorporation in those products and the fact that it 
provides a reticle image in the field of view of the user's eye 
without the use of any refractive elements and without any 
image minification.
