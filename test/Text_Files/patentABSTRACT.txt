A viewfinder, particularly useful in a camera, is lensleSS but 
which provides a useful reticle to aid the user to properly 
frame the desired Scene. A camera body includes a view 
finder  front  wall  opening.  Surrounding the  front  wall 
opening, on its interior Surface is a concave mirror with its 
focus on a reticle. The reticle on an internal Surface of the 
camera body is located at the interior face of the eyepiece 
opening region of the viewfinder. Incoming light at the front 
opening illuminates the reticle and its image is reflected by 
the  concave  mirror Surface  to  the  user's  eye.  In  one 
embodiment, the front opening of the camera is a Single 
opening larger than the rear or eyepiece opening, and in 
another embodiment, the front opening constitutes a Series 
of Small holes in the front wall of the camera with the Surface 
between the holes reflectorized and acting as the concave 
mirror. In another embodiment also adapted particularly for 
Zoom lens cameras, a reticle  mask is included within the 
camera body and is adjustable with the Zoom position of the 
taking lens to change the Size of the reticle. This feature 
includes a pair of movable L-shaped masks, each including 
an L-shaped reticle and which combine to produce a variable 
Size rectangular reticle.
