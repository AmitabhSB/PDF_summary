4, 5–7, 8-9, is my basic viewfinder, which uses no lenses, but which forms a bright image  of a  reticle  at  the  distance  of the  Scene  to  be photographed.My proposed viewfinder uses reflective optics which can be molded as part of the front and rear walls, FW and RW respectively,  of the  camera body CB  FIGS.), achieving the same results as more complex and expensive lens viewfinders.There is no directly exposed transparent Surface which may become Soiled or Scratched, and no Subassembly opera tions for the Viewfinder are required in manufacturing.It should be noted that minification of an image, in prior art  viewfinders,  is  not  a  user  advantage, but  done  for engineering reasons, to be able  to  use Small viewfinder lenses and maintain the field of view which matches that of the camera taking lens.A one-to-one, or full size, image, before my invention has usually been implemented in only the Single lens refleX cameras, using a complex and expen Sive lens and prism System or in the least expensive Single use  cameras which have not provided sharply  focussed frame lenses.A variation of the Albada viewfinder could be made in which the front and back glass or plastic elements were curved meniscus elements which had no refractive power; however, this would save no cost over the traditional Albada design.My proposed lensleSS Viewfinder does not result in mini fication;  however, provides a  Sharply  imaged  frame  of reference.nothing, except reflective metallizing; however it creates a rectangular frame which appears to be Superimposed on the Scene.A precise Smooth Surface produced in the injec tion  molding process of the  opaque camera body  may provide sufficient reflectivity  to provide a usable  reticle image without metallizing.Any form of image capture means, film or electronic Storage is usable with this invention.The reticle is so thin and out of focus as to be un-noticeable.When this invention is applied to a more complex camera Such as one which provides various aspect ratioS or Zoom operation, there is a need to change the reticle Size to provide a  matching field of View through the Viewfinder, again, without the  use  of lenses.The design of taking lens assemblies, shutter mechanisms and film advances for cam eras are well known and will be Selected in accordance with well known design principles in the photographic industry therefore are not illustrated here.4-6 is, however, replaced by an adjustable or movable reticle which changes in size with changes in focal length of the lens assembly ZL.The reticle of this embodiment is, preferably, formed from two relatively movable masks, designated for convenience based upon their relative  location in the embodiment of FIGS.The two masks BLM and TRM are each notched to define a variable size rectan gular opening when Superimposed and moved in diagonally opposing directions of the double ended arrow in FIG.Movement of the actuator pins LAP and RAP is accom plished Since they are connected to a regulating disc RD which is rotatably mounted for rotation within a recessed cylindrical cavity in the rear wall RW of the camera body CB.Suffice it to say, the masks BLM and TRM are both coupled to the Zoom adjustment of lens assembly ZL for coordinated movement therewith.Further, the overall position of the mask mechanism can be collectively shifted to compensate for parallax errors when close focusing, and differentially shifted to accommodate various aspect ratioS.4, 5–7, 8-9, is my basic viewfinder, which uses no lenses, but which forms a bright image  of a  reticle  at  the  distance  of the  Scene  to  be photographed.My proposed viewfinder uses reflective optics which can be molded as part of the front and rear walls, FW and RW respectively,  of the  camera body CB  FIGS.), achieving the same results as more complex and expensive lens viewfinders.There is no directly exposed transparent Surface which may become Soiled or Scratched, and no Subassembly opera tions for the Viewfinder are required in manufacturing.It should be noted that minification of an image, in prior art  viewfinders,  is  not  a  user  advantage, but  done  for engineering reasons, to be able  to  use Small viewfinder lenses and maintain the field of view which matches that of the camera taking lens.A one-to-one, or full size, image, before my invention has usually been implemented in only the Single lens refleX cameras, using a complex and expen Sive lens and prism System or in the least expensive Single use  cameras which have not provided sharply  focussed frame lenses.A variation of the Albada viewfinder could be made in which the front and back glass or plastic elements were curved meniscus elements which had no refractive power;
