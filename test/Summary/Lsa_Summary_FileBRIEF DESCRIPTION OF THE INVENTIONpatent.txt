The user then can obtain properly framed photoS as when using much more expensive cameras.In the case of a Zoom lens camera, the Same basic lensleSS viewfinder is  formed in  the camera body with its  front opening and concave mirror.The reticle, however, is formed in two parts,  on diagonally opposite corners of the  rear opening, described below.Within the camera body in the viewfinder optical path are a pair of L-shaped sliding masks which define a variableBy comparison  with  the  prior  viewfinders  discussedPros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.No motion parallax between frame and scene.Image of scene remains full size as in the most expensive SLRs.Costs approximates that of using no viewfinder.Quality suitable for more expensive cameras as well.Cons: --- Pros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.No motion parallax between frame and scene.Image of scene remains full size as in the most expensive SLRs.Costs approximates that of using no viewfinder.Quality suitable for more expensive cameras as well.Provides a wider field of view of the scene than the reticle, to aid composition.Accommodates a range of reticle sizes, required by Zoom cameras.Cons: eye relief is slightly reduced for wide-angle position.This viewfinder is not limited to cameras but may be used in other applications, as well.The Single use camera is a prime candidate for its application because of its low cost, ease of incorporation in those products and the fact that it provides a reticle image in the field of view of the user's eye without the use of any refractive elements and without any image minification.The user then can obtain properly framed photoS as when using much more expensive cameras.In the case of a Zoom lens camera, the Same basic lensleSS viewfinder is  formed in  the camera body with its  front opening and concave mirror.The reticle, however, is formed in two parts,  on diagonally opposite corners of the  rear opening, described below.Within the camera body in the viewfinder optical path are a pair of L-shaped sliding masks which define a variableBy comparison  with  the  prior  viewfinders  discussedPros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.No motion parallax between frame and scene.Image of scene remains full size as in the most expensive SLRs.Costs approximates that of using no viewfinder.Quality suitable for more expensive cameras as well.Cons: --- Pros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.No motion parallax between frame and scene.Image of scene remains full size as in the most expensive SLRs.Costs approximates that of using no viewfinder.Quality suitable for more expensive cameras as well.Provides a wider field of view of the scene than the reticle, to aid composition.Accommodates a range of reticle sizes, required by Zoom cameras.Cons: eye relief is slightly reduced for wide-angle position.This viewfinder is not limited to cameras but may be used in other applications, as well.The Single use camera is a prime candidate for its application because of its low cost, ease of incorporation in those products and the fact that it provides a reticle image in the field of view of the user's eye without the use of any refractive elements and without any image minification.The user then can obtain properly framed photoS as when using much more expensive cameras.In the case of a Zoom lens camera, the Same basic lensleSS viewfinder is  formed in  the camera body with its  front opening and concave mirror.The reticle, however, is formed in two parts,  on diagonally opposite corners of the  rear opening, described below.Within the camera body in the viewfinder optical path are a pair of L-shaped sliding masks which define a variableBy comparison  with  the  prior  viewfinders  discussedPros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.No motion parallax between frame and scene.Image of scene remains full size as in the most expensive SLRs.Costs approximates that of using no viewfinder.Quality suitable for more expensive cameras as well.Cons: --- Pros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.No motion parallax between frame and scene.Image of scene remains full size as in the most expensive SLRs.Costs approximates that of using no viewfinder.Quality suitable for more expensive cameras as well.Provides a wider field of view of the scene than the reticle, to aid composition.Accommodates a range of reticle sizes, required by Zoom cameras.Cons: eye relief is slightly reduced for wide-angle position.This viewfinder is not limited to cameras but may be used in other applications, as well.The Single use camera is a prime candidate for its application because of its low cost, ease of incorporation in those products and the fact that it provides a reticle image in the field of view of the user's eye without the use of any refractive elements and without any image minification.
