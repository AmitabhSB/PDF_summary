Viewfinders find many uses and are of particular impor tance in cameras to aid the photographer in framing the Subject.In order to provide accurate framing, Viewfinders have been used which require the use of a minimum of two lenses, to which reflective optical coatings are added (the Albada viewfinder).A number of viewfinders have been devised.Small hole in rear wall of camera.Acceptable for only the least expensive cameras.Comments: Small hole near eye acts as a pin-hole lens.Pros: Image of scene and front frame sharp.Comments: Created by adding reflective coatings to reverse Galilean viewfinder lenses.Pros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.Image is minified making it harder to see.2,  so  named because it makes use of one positive and one negative lens, as Galileo used in the first telescope.The Albada viewfinder as illustrated in FIG.Also a frame or reticle is formed on the interior Surface of the positive lens, usually by metal deposition.In each of these types of prior art cameras which are represented in the accompanying drawings, FIGS.and typical images Seen therein are represented by FIGS.Many cameras, including low cost point and shoot cam eras provide Zoom capability.For Such applications, a reticle is even more important to accurately frame the photograph.In the photo finishing business, a cropping aid is used which consists of a pair of planar right angled notched sheets which are movable to define a variable size exposure rect angle.In certain complex lens type ViewfinderS Similar planar masking devices have been used.This type of adjustment has not, heretofore, been applied to a lensleSS Viewfinder.Viewfinders find many uses and are of particular impor tance in cameras to aid the photographer in framing the Subject.In order to provide accurate framing, Viewfinders have been used which require the use of a minimum of two lenses, to which reflective optical coatings are added (the Albada viewfinder).A number of viewfinders have been devised.Small hole in rear wall of camera.Acceptable for only the least expensive cameras.Comments: Small hole near eye acts as a pin-hole lens.Pros: Image of scene and front frame sharp.Comments: Created by adding reflective coatings to reverse Galilean viewfinder lenses.Pros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.Image is minified making it harder to see.2,  so  named because it makes use of one positive and one negative lens, as Galileo used in the first telescope.The Albada viewfinder as illustrated in FIG.Also a frame or reticle is formed on the interior Surface of the positive lens, usually by metal deposition.In each of these types of prior art cameras which are represented in the accompanying drawings, FIGS.and typical images Seen therein are represented by FIGS.Many cameras, including low cost point and shoot cam eras provide Zoom capability.For Such applications, a reticle is even more important to accurately frame the photograph.In the photo finishing business, a cropping aid is used which consists of a pair of planar right angled notched sheets which are movable to define a variable size exposure rect angle.In certain complex lens type ViewfinderS Similar planar masking devices have been used.This type of adjustment has not, heretofore, been applied to a lensleSS Viewfinder.Viewfinders find many uses and are of particular impor tance in cameras to aid the photographer in framing the Subject.In order to provide accurate framing, Viewfinders have been used which require the use of a minimum of two lenses, to which reflective optical coatings are added (the Albada viewfinder).A number of viewfinders have been devised.Small hole in rear wall of camera.Acceptable for only the least expensive cameras.Comments: Small hole near eye acts as a pin-hole lens.Pros: Image of scene and front frame sharp.Comments: Created by adding reflective coatings to reverse Galilean viewfinder lenses.Pros: Bright rectangular frame is imaged in the scene.Image is minified making it harder to see.2,  so  named because it makes use of one positive and one negative lens, as Galileo used in the first telescope.The Albada viewfinder as illustrated in FIG.Also a frame or reticle is formed on the interior Surface of the positive lens, usually by metal deposition.In each of these types of prior art cameras which are represented in the accompanying drawings, FIGS.and typical images Seen therein are represented by FIGS.Many cameras, including low cost point and shoot cam eras provide Zoom capability.For Such applications, a reticle is even more important to accurately frame the photograph.In the photo finishing business, a cropping aid is used which consists of a pair of planar right angled notched sheets which are movable to define a variable size exposure rect angle.In certain complex lens type ViewfinderS Similar planar masking devices have been used.This type of adjustment has not, heretofore, been applied to a lensleSS Viewfinder.
